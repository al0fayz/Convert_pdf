    <h4 id="title">Opportunities</h4>
    <p>
      We collect over 170 variables for each of the more than 300 million domains in our database. All this data can lead to valuable insights to grow and understand your business. You could use all this data to, for example:
    </p>
    <h4 id="title">Look for websites that have content related to your top-level domain</h4>
    <p>
      If we look at the dot Earth top-level domain, there are probably many environmental organizations or even world-wide shipping companies that can benefit from using this new top-level-domain. You can use our dataset to look for those websites that contain certain words related to Earth in their title, description or keywords and target them or the registrar they use with a specialized offer to grow your business.
    </p>
    <h4 id="title">Find domain names taht end in your top level domain, but currently use another ending</h4>
    <p>
      there are plenty of websites that have a domain ending in the word bike, who do not use a dot BIke top-level domain yet. All these websites can be found in our database and turned into a targeted sales list to create an efficient tool for the sales team of the registrar you currently work with, or to improve your own marketing efforts.
    </p>
    <h4 id="title">Search for company names that have your top-level domain in them, but don't use that top-level domain to their benefit yet</h4>
    <p>
      Rather than only looking at the website and its characteristics, it is also an option to focus on the company behind the website. Let's say you offer the dot Accountant top-level domain and are looking for more businesses that could profit from using it. The database gives you the opportunity to look for the word accountant in all company names that we have indexed and see which registrar they are curently with a way to create a selective sales list and improve your lead generation.
    </p>
    <h4 id="title">Select websites with a subdomain that is similar or the same as your top-level domain</h4>
    <p>
      The subdomains that a website uses can be good indication of their interest, such as the use of a jobs subdomain. It is possible to look for the subdomains being used by website and contact them directly or reach out to their registrar. The dot jobs top-level domain to ilustrate could use this data to expand their zone file in an efficient way.
    </p>
    <h4 id="title">Focus on website with a physical location that is related to your top-level domain</h4>
    <p>
      Internet users are most often only aware of the existence of a country code top-level domain. But there are plenty of businesses that do not want to target an entire country and prefer to focus on a specific location such as a region or city. Our data can be used to determine the physical location of almost all websites and thus provide information that is especially relevant for the growth of a dot Berlin, a dot Tokyo or a similar geographic top-level domain.
    </p>
    <h4 id="title">Set up a twitter campaign to target Twitter users</h4>
    <p>
      In additional to domain information and website content, our database also includes multiple variables on social media use. This provides a unique opportunity to target website owners through social media channels such as twitter. If we go back to the dot Earth example, the Twitter account information can be selected and used to determine which of these .
